## HomeAway Coding Challenge 

A coding challenge submission that uses the Seat Geek API to fetch and display events. Events can be favorited and are persisted to a plist on the device.

URLSession was used to fetch JSON responses from Seat Geek. JSONDecoder was used to parse JSON responses.

AlamofireImage was used to asynchronously download and cache images.

Basic unit tests for query and favorites included.
